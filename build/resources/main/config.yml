# Thank you for using the Two Factor Authentication plugin by Liel Amar.
# Special thanks to Connor Linfoot for developing the original MC2FA plugin.

# How much delay should the plugin apply to loading players when the server reloads
# This is useful when you have multiple databases with different latencies
# You can use it to ensure your permissions plugin loads before the players are reloaded
# * It's best to set the value to 0 if you use the same storage type AND storage (server/file), because you won't have latency differences anyways
